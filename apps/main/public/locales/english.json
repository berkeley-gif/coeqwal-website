Here are all the places where CalSim anticipates an amount of water. We call the points nodes and the lines arcs. We can think of nodes as places where water amounts can be measured, and arcs as the channels that carry water. Thinking of the nodes types as inflow, storage, flow, groundwater, and deliveries can help us understand the data.",
